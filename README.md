# Unofficial Golang Interactive Brokers API

`ibapi` package provides an **unofficial** Golang implementation of the [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php) API. It is designed to mirror the official Python or C++ [tws-api](https://github.com/InteractiveBrokers) provided by Interactive Brokers.
**We will do our best to keep it in sync** with the official API releases to ensure compatibility and feature parity, but users should be aware that this is a community-driven project and may lag behind the official versions at times.

> [!CAUTION]
> This package is in the **beta phase**. While functional, it may still have bugs or incomplete features. Please test extensively in non-production environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Go** version 1.23 or higher (recommended)
- An **Interactive Brokers** account with TWS or IB Gateway installed and running

### Installation
Install the package via `go get`:
```bash
go get -u github.com/scmhub/ibapi
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example to connect and place an order using this package:
```go
package main

import (
	"math/rand"
	"time"

	"github.com/scmhub/ibapi"
)

const (
	IB_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
	IB_PORT = 7497
)

func main() {
	// We set logger for pretty logs to console
	log := ibapi.Logger()
	ibapi.SetConsoleWriter()

	// New IB CLient
	ib := ibapi.NewEClient(nil)
	
    // Connect client
	if err := ib.Connect(IB_HOST, IB_PORT, rand.Int63n(999999)); err != nil {
		log.Error().Err(err)
		return
	}

    // Create and place order
	id := 1
	eurusd := &ibapi.Contract{Symbol: "EUR", SecType: "CASH", Currency: "USD", Exchange: "IDEALPRO"}
	limitOrder := ibapi.LimitOrder("BUY", ibapi.StringToDecimal("20000"), 1.08)
	ib.PlaceOrder(id, eurusd, limitOrder)

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

	err := ib.Disconnect()
	if err != nil {
		log.Error().Err(err).Msg("Disconnect")
	}
}
```
